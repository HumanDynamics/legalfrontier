Advances in computer technology have allowed data scientists to analyze vast troves of information and to use them to find patterns that were previously unattainable.  This new science has been used to master Jeopardy, to defeat world class experts at chess, and to more accurately diagnose certain cancers.

At the same time, in courtrooms across the United States, judges and juries devote millions of man-hours to making estimates of their own. This essay is chiefly concerned with one sort of estimate: that of what a reasonable person would do in a given context.  This "reasonable person" standard is at the heart of many areas of tort law.  Simply put, liability attaches when a person creates a harm that a reasonable person would not and causes someone else to suffer injuries..  In 1882, Oliver Wendell Holmes described this standard: “what would be blameworthy in the average man, the man of ordinary intelligence and prudence, and determines liability by that.” #1

Here, I argue that in many situations, what an "average person" would do is calcluable, and calculable to a degree unthinkable to twelve untrained jurors basing a decision on trial testimony and exhibits.  

<u>The TJ Hooper v. Northern Barge</u>, 53 F.2d 107 (S.D.N.Y. 1931)

A Depression Era case involving tug boats lays out both the opportunity, and the challenges of this approach.  In TJ Hooper, A company operates two tugs, each towing three barges full of coal for delivery. En route, the tugs encountered a storm which sank the last barge of each tug's tow. The evidence suggests that there was a weather report broadcast over radio which would have warned the tug-captains of the weather and persuaded them to put into harbor. However, the tug-captains only had private radio receiving sets which were broken and their employer did not furnish them with sets for work. At the time of the incident, there was no industry standard or custom of furnishing all boats with radio receivers.

Now imagine if that case had been decided in the age of data science.  For sake of ease, let's assume there are 3 manufacturers of radio equipment suitable for maritime use, and each of them uses typical tools for tracking their customers.  With a subpoena to each, it would be possible to obtain their complete list of customers within the tug boat industry. The information could then be sorted with a click of a button. It might reveal that only 3% of tug boats used radios.  Given Holmes's definition of the reasonable person standard (which, in the TJ Hooper case would mean a reasonable company), it would be simple work to establish that the average tug boat owner of ordinary prudence would not, at the time of the incident, have had a radio on board

Appendix: A Science Fiction Story for the Legal Reader

Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  December 2033.

A commuter dashes across an outdoor subway platform on a sleety, cold winter day, in an effort to board the last car before the doors close.  Just feet away from the train, she slips and falls on an ice patch, suffering serious injuries. 
After being released from the hospital, she contacts a lawyer, who believes the subway operator “breached its duty of due care by failing to make safe the icy and snowy conditions that existed on the platform.”  In its defense, the subway operator claims that, not only did it act reasonably, but that the plaintiff’s claim should be barred because “her contributory negligence in failing to act as a reasonable person under the circumstances [by running across an icy platform] was the sole cause of her injuries.”
The trial is a brief one, occurring just weeks after the plaintiff’s medical course had ended.  On the day of the trial, the attorneys walk with their clients into the courthouse and approach the CompuJury kiosk, where they upload a thumb drive full of evidence.  They then look solemnly at their clients and plaintiff’s counsel presses the “DECIDE” button. 
CompuJury deliberates for a full 6 seconds, before printing a verdict slip stating that the defendant was 100% negligent and that the plaintiff was 0% comparatively at fault.
The back of the CompuJury form (which is a key part of the record for the human-based appellate tribunal) explained the decision’s basis:
After reviewing the evidence contained on the thumb drive (which contained answers to interrogatories, deposition transcripts of the parties and other witnesses, as well as video footage of more than 6,000 commuters crossing the platform that day), CompJury could project how a reasonable person would walk on the platform. 
As programmed (and this programming was based on an act of the state legislature deciding the parameters), it defined “reasonable” as whether one was within 30-70% of the median for speed, walking stability, and focus on the task of at hand for an individual of the age and health of the plaintiff.  In making its decision, CompuJury explained, the plaintiff, though moving a little faster than average, and being slightly more distracted than average (she had her iPhone in hand, but was not looking at it), she was in the 35% percentile for reasonability based on the how others conducted themselves.  The plaintiff was, therefore, within the margin by which no fault would attach. 
With respect to the defendant, it found that the defendant had behaved unreasonably because, under similar circumstances, similar ice patches to the one on which the plaintiff slipped were cleared within 10 minutes, but the plaintiff’s ice patch had been there a full 30 minutes (“reasonably speed” to cure the harm would have been 8-20 minutes, said the system).  It also reviewed industry standards in its database and found that several national organizations said that no ice patch should ever be allowed to exist in an area traversed by customers for more than 15 minutes.
 
Before leaving the CompuJury kiosk, one more piece of paper came from the machine: a slip of paper for the parties to upload into DamagesBot as the next phase of the trial, along with medical records, bills, and the plaintiff’s discovery responses about the impact of her injuries on her life.  For another small fee, DamagesBot would be immediately available to render a decision on the plaintiff’s present and future medical costs, as well as to assess her non-economic damages based on surveys from community members about the value of various injuries in various contexts.
