In reading Design of Everything Things again, Norman says that we constantly attribute bad outcomes to the final, human cause, but rarely look for the design error that allowed it to happen.  He says that by doing some root cause analysis, we could change the design to reduce (or prevent) occurrence of the final human error causing the injury.  I think he’s darn right.
 
So why don’t we design a system like this for law?  One where any time there’s a serious injury, we don’t just ask what happened (duh, the driver fell asleep and went off the road and hit a pedestrian), and start asking “well, why was he able to fall asleep while driving?”).  

We then create a system of reporting these root causes so people or entities potentially in a position to fix it have the chance to avoid the problems before they occur.  As technologies improve, it may be that there are better solutions available to previously hard-to-fix problems, even once the root cause was identified 

(imagine if someone 50 years ago did root cause analysis for all of these terrible cases involving kids getting run over in their driveways by backing vehicles.  The root cause might include “because the driver couldn’t see behind the car.”  Well, in 1967, you’d shrug your shoulders and maybe think about fixes alternative to driver visibility (e.g. a beeping sound), but fast forward to our era, rear-view cams are easily available and cost-effective.  As tech changes, we can use the data gathered from a system of root cause analyses to improve safety.).
 
Ironically, it might also shift the way liability works in negligence cases.  If you’ve gotten 10,000 reports of people dying as a result of “human errors” involving drivers falling asleep and hitting other cars, now all the sudden the vehicle manufacturers have reasonable notice of the design flaw they’re posing for others and need to take reasonable measures to cure it.
 
When Adam Foss did his TED Talk (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwin6fT1gf3WAhWI5oMKHUbgDcQQyCkIKjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fadam_foss_a_prosecutor_s_vision_for_a_better_justice_system&usg=AOvVaw2vZ9SfAA9Qebgh7hYe-uZG) on letting young offenders off the hook for crimes in exchange for engaging in positive chagnes (education, jobs, etc.), the reason it was so intuitively great was because Adam stopped looking at the ultimate event (the crime), and started thinking about fixing things closer to the root as a better way to help the accused and to help society.  

Why not do that for injury cases, too?
